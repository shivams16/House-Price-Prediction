# House-Price-Prediction

- Problem Statement The aim of this project is to evaluate proficiency in end-to-end Machine Learning Projects.
- Dataset The dataset for this assignment is the House Prices Dataset. It contains various features of the houses. The sale price is the target variable.
- Instructions
Submission is to be made in .ipynb format.
Should have a table of contents.
Should have the necessary documentation.
Important observations to be noted.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights about the data.
Univariate Analysis
 i. Visualize the distribution of the continuous variables.
 ii. Visualize the categories for the categorical variables.
Bi-variate Analysis
 i. Visualize the relationship between the continuous variables and the target variable
 ii. Visualize the relationship between the categorical variables and the target variable
 iii. Calculate the correlation coefficients between the pairs of continuous-continuous, continuous-categorical, and categorical-categorical variables. 
Summarize descriptive statistics of the variables.
Preprocess the data as necessary to prepare it for modeling. This should include handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and transforming the data as necessary.
Apply at least the following types of models:
A linear model with regularization
A Bagging model (e.g. Random Forest, Extra trees, etc.)
A boosting model (e.g. Adaboost, Gradient boosting, etc.)
Use cross-validation techniques.
Tune the hyperparameters for all the models.
Try feature selection techniques.
Use stacking of multiple models to improve performance.
Check the residuals for homoscedasticity and normal distribution.
Analyze the feature importances from different models to gain insights about which features are more important for prediction.
